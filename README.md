### Simple pomodoro app in js ###
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Basically a todo app that’s tied to a timer (all on the client side). Pomodoros are usually 25 minutes intervals but for this demo make them 25 seconds. 

**The app will need:**
- [ ] input form (task name)
- [ ] task list (name and time remaining)
- [ ] some kind of alert when the task time as completed, with a button to start the timer for the next task.

**Bonus points:**
- [ ] rename/remove/reorder tasks
- [ ] slick/creative GUI

**We would like you to create this app twice.**
 - [ ] One version using no frameworks (beyond a DOM manipulation library like jquery or xui)
 - [ ] a second version using the framework of your choice (backbone, ember, angular, etc).


We will be interested in seeing your personal javascript style as well as you style utilizing a framework. We’ll be looking for simple/slim code with good logic and a strong command of OOP.
